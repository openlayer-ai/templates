"""This file is used by Openlayer to run the model and get its outputs.

If you go to openlayer.json, you'll see that the `batchCommand` field points here.

The openlayer_run.py must contain 2 things:

1. A class that inherits from OpenlayerModel and implements the `run` method.
2. A `__main__` block that creates an instance of the class and calls the `run_from_cli`
method.

The model is imported from the `.app.model.langchain_model` module, which is
where we used Openlayer's callback handler, for tracing.
