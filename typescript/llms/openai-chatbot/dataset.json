        "groundTruth": "The meaning of life is a philosophical question that has been debated for centuries. Different cultures, religions, and individuals may have different beliefs about the purpose of life. Some believe that the meaning of life is to seek happiness and fulfillment, others believe it is to fulfill a spiritual or religious purpose, and some believe that life has no inherent meaning and it is up to each individual to create their own meaning. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a subjective and personal question that each person must answer for themselves."
